# Java Banking System ðŸ’³

This project is a **console-based banking system** built in Java that allows users to create and manage accounts, perform transactions, and calculate interest â€” all while enforcing robust input validation and test-driven development.

## Features
- Create and manage multiple bank accounts (e.g., checking, savings)
- Perform transactions: deposits, withdrawals, transfers
- Calculate APR and apply interest over time
- Validate and process user input through structured command handling
- Built with object-oriented principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Tested using a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach

## Technologies
- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
- JUnit (for unit testing)
- Git (for version control)
